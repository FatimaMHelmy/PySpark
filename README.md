# PySpark
This project is a hands-on tutorial on how to use Spark for data processing and analysis, with a focus on Spark SQL, DataFrames, Structured Streaming, and Machine Learning (MLlib). The project includes code examples and explanations for various Spark features and APIs.

## Installation
- pyspark 3.4.0
- numpy 1.24.3
- pandas 2.0.1

## Usage

Spark SQL is Apache Sparkâ€™s module for working with structured data. It allows you to seamlessly mix SQL queries with Spark programs. With PySpark DataFrames you can efficiently read, write, transform, and analyze data using Python and SQL. Whether you use Python or SQL, the same underlying execution engine is used so you will always leverage the full power of Spark.

## RDD Operations

I Explained how to use Spark's Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) for distributed data processing and analysis with examples of how to create, manipulate, and transform RDDs.

### Spark SQL

I used Spark SQL for data processing and analysis. Gave  examples of common operations such as filtering, grouping, aggregating, and joining.

### DataFrames

I used Spark DataFrames for structured data processing and analysis. Gave examples of how to create, manipulate, and query DataFrames.

### Structured Streaming

 I Used Spark Structured Streaming for real-time data processing and analysis. created streaming data sources, process data streams, and output the results.

### Machine Learning (MLlib)

I Explained  how to use Spark's MLlib library for machine learning tasks such as classification, regression.
